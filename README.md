# thrive-technical

This solution is a bare-bones procedural script to acheive the specs of the technical test. Improvements could be made to make the code more SOLID using classes to isolate the core input, processing and output logic. Composition could then be used to instatiate a class as needed. This would make the code easier to read and maintain. However, for the pusposes of this exercise, such requirements were not specifed.

*To run*
Ensure you are in root folder `/thrive-technical`
Run IRB in console `irb`
Load script `load 'script.rb`
